# Discord-DM-on-Reaction

Basically yea, it dms when someone reacts to a message. If it doesnt work as expected please make an issue as i've made this pretty fast.

Released this because people charge 100$+ for this which is a bit weird for such a simple program.

if u have an suggestion make an issue, at 25 stars i'll implement some suggestions 


**USAGE**

1 - pip uninstall discord.py
2 - pip install discord.py-self httpx more-itertools
